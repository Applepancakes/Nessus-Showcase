# Vulnerablity management via Nessus security tool


Here in this lab, we will be showcasing Vulnerablity assessment, managment, and remeditation.

This is simply a windows 10 VM, fresh image.
We see in these 2 images that there are minor alerts as well as notices indicating what device information is visible(manufacture information and Mac address are both visible)

Note, these 2 initial scans did not use Nessus's credential scan feature. These next scans will use the VM's user credentials for a more indepth security scan.
We see more details, Microsoft Explorer having vulnerablity issues due to an out-of-date version. Same with pending windows updates, critical due to having a cascading affect on other windows products needing those relevant patches.

This next scan will make use of a very outdated version of the Mozilla Firefox browser.

As we can see, big vulnerablity.

We can look in each vulnerablity in more detail to see what specifically is an issue.

With the risks assessed, we can go in to the remediation and ensure device security. Update
